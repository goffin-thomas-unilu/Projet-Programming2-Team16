# Project Description 
## Context & Basic Narrative
### Context
 In a world where fantastic creatures are commonplace, mankind must fight terrifying monsters to survive.
Among all the kingdoms in existence, the Kingdom of Midland is one of the most powerful, with the Imperial Order and a number of powerful individuals acting on their behalf, known as Heros.
### History
The protagonist is one of these Heroes, commissioned by the Imperial Order to investigate a certain dungeon, the Karadûm's Keep, following numerous attacks in the region, to eliminate the monsters. Little does the protagonist know that he will find something more than a problem for the Midland's Kingdom.
