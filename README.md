# Programming 2 (2025): Fighting Adventure - Template

Build your game on top of the provided framework `Sources/prog2-2025-project/FightingAdventureFramework`.
- Do not modify the files contained in that folder!
- You can find an example project using that framework in the lab solutions repository.

## Possible issue when building

Double-check the .vscode/launch.json file:
- Wherever you see the line `workspaceFolder:prog2-2025-project-template`, adjust it to your group's repository name.
- Normally VSC adjusts this automatically, but if it hasn't then perform this change yourself.
